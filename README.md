  This application using data from https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3.
  
  The amount of request send to Youtube is very limited due to Quota system.
  
  The YouTube Data API uses a quota to ensure that developers use the service as intended and do not create applications that unfairly reduce service quality or limit access for others.
  
  Google calculates your quota usage by assigning a cost to each request. Different types of operations have different quota costs and a search request costs 100 quota units.
  
  Since you only have 10000 units per day, searching too much will make the app cant fetch any more data at all.
  
  So please dont spamming. 
  
  Sincere
